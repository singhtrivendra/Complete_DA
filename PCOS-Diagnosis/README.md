# PCOS Diagnosis

_This project aims to predict Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using various clinical and biochemical features. The dataset comprises information about patients with and without infertility issues. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a Random Forest classification model._

### Overview:
This project includes:

* Merging of two datasets based on patient file numbers.
* Preprocessing of the data for handling missing values and encode categorical variables.
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations.
* Built a Random Forest classification model to predict the presence of PCOS.
* Optimized the model using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
* Evaluated the model performance with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
