# üß© Complete Data Analytics Skillset

This repository demonstrates my end-to-end **Data Analytics** skills through three projects ‚Äî covering the entire workflow from **data preprocessing, cleaning, ETL, SQL querying, EDA, data visualization**, to **predictive modeling**.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in:
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** using Python (pandas, NumPy)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **ETL and SQL Data Management** using PostgreSQL
- **Data Visualization & BI Reporting** using Power BI and DAX
- **Machine Learning Modeling** using scikit-learn (Random Forest, feature selection, evaluation metrics)

Together, these projects represent a complete **Data Analytics Lifecycle** ‚Äî from raw data to actionable insights.
